# Notes
Notes for a [Road Map](RoadToDataScientist.png) and my goal to complete it.
[Table Of Contents](TableOfContents.notes)

## Goals: 
- Reach the end of the roadmap knowing that I learned about each node.
- Get a job as a machine learning developer/data scientist at a place of my chooseing (currently google as of 1/19/2020)

## Rewards
-   ## Weekly
    - 3 hours of video game time.
-   ## On Completion
    - Upgrading of my computer
    - A vacation choosen by me (Emily Agreed to this)

## Timeline:
- 1-8+ hour spent on a node/review (varies depending on busyness with homework and such.)
    # Business Checklist
    - Are you in school? -3 hours
    - Every 2 hours of home work removes 1 hour of time.
    - Family/Friend event? -2 hours (Dads house only -1. Brief(1-2 hours) visits do not count)
    - 1 hours minimum for review! (If for some reason you run out of review, 1 hour towards the next node.)

## Node
- A circle on the map, that stands for an item that must be known in order to move on.

## Item
- Some nodes container a list of things that you must know in order to move on. An Item references each individual item of the list.

## Node Completion requirements:
- A detailed definition of the node item/s. Ensure by reading it, one is able to complete the tasks below with no other information.
- Depending on nature of the item:
    1. Code a simple example demonstraiting the idea
    2. Complete 5+ practice problems
- Provide an example of how it is being used today.

## Node Check off requirements:
- Return to previous nodes and:
    1. Reread the definition/s of the item/s
    2. Complete 1+ practive problem/s per item
    3. Think of a way that each item could be used.
- After each of these requirements is met add a "!" in the table on contents next to the title
- Once the are 10 "!" each reprisenting a revisit to the node, one no longer needs to review it during a review session.
